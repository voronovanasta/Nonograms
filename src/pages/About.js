  <h2>Nonograms</h2>
  <p>
  In <strong>1987</strong> , Non Ishida, a Japanese graphics editor, won a competition in Tokyo by designing grid pictures using skyscraper lights which are turned on or off. At the same time and with no connection, a professional Japanese puzzler named Tetsuya Nishio invents the same puzzles. From this, the concept of Paint by numbers and picture-forming logic puzzles was born.
  </p>
  <p><strong>In 1988</strong>, Non Ishida published three picture grid puzzles in Japan under the name of "Window Art Puzzles".<br>
  <strong>In 1990</strong>, James Dalgety in the UK invented the name Nonograms after Non Ishida, and The Sunday Telegraph started publishing them on a weekly basis.<br>
  <strong>In 1993</strong>, First book of Nonograms was published by Non Ishida in Japan. The Sunday Telegraph published a dedicated puzzle book titled the "Book of Nonograms". Nonograms are also published in Sweden, United States, South Africa and other countries.
